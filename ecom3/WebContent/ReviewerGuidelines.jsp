Reviewing Guidelines
</h1>
<p>
The journal’s reviewing process is in place to ensure only the best submissions are selected for publications within the Journal. 

The purpose of the peer reviews is threefold: They allow users to get involved within the creation of the journal, deeming what is 

worthy and what is not. Reviewing an article will ‘cover the cost’ of running the journal, acting as a form of ‘tribute’ in order 

for your article submission to be published, and finally they allow the Editors to handle a larger Journal much easier by identifying poorer articles quicker.

You should ensure you have thoroughly read and understood the article you have selected to review. Your review should touch upon 

the finer points of the article: structure, suitable content, relevant diagrams, etc., whilst also noting poorer practises that should 

be revised or brought to the attention of an editor.

As mentioned within the submission guidelines, you will be required to successfully peer review three articles in order for your article to be published.

Review Procedure
</h1>

<p>
Once you have submitted your article or signed up to be a reviewer, you will be e-mailed your login credentials. 

You must be logged-in in order to review an article.

To begin, select the articles you wish to review by following ‘Choose Articles’ – you can revise your choice if required. 

You can browse all titles and abstracts of articles awaiting review.

Once selected , you are committed to review that article and cannot change your review choice. You now have access to

 download the article in PDF format just go to the ""Reviews Selected by User" tab. You are advised to download the file and read it offline. You will have one week to 
 
 submit your review response in the Review Form, see below for more details.

Within this time period, the author of the selected article may choose to respond to any comments/ criticism you may have and 

revise their article, as required. You are permitted to then alter the contents of your review, if your arisen points have been dealt with 

and deem necessary. This should be done no more than twice – an article that still contains poor content should be picked by an Editor, via your 

comments, at this point.1 Week after the review is submitted no more changes to the review are allowed.

One of three outcomes can occur once you have submitted your final review:1) The review could be deemed rushed, incomplete or invalid and sent 

back to you to revise.2) The review may be considered false, in terms of collusion with the author and be rejected entirely.3) The review is deemed 

worthy by an Editor and suitable for the journal. The article will be set to be published within the next edition of the journal and you will be 

credited with the review. This will count as one of your three required peer reviews for your article to be published.

NOTE: We strongly advise the selection of an older article, regardless of your level of expertises. Do not be afraid to review articles of subjects 

you are unfamiliar in – a well written article should be accessible to all within your field.
